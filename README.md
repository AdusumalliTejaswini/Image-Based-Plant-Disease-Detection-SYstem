Plant Disease Detection System

Overview:
This project aims to develop an image-based plant disease detection system using deep learning techniques. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the system can identify whether the plant is healthy or infected with a disease. This can aid farmers and agronomists in early detection and management of plant diseases, thereby improving crop yield and reducing losses.

Features:
Image Classification: The system classifies plant images into healthy or diseased categories.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing results.
Dataset: Uses a curated dataset of plant images with annotations for training and evaluation.


Dataset:
The dataset used for training the Image-Based Plant Disease Detection  model consists of images of various plants of different kinds. It  is available for download by using the below link:
